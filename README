Intro
This project is the final project of the course taken in Tel-Aviv University, 
Faculty of Engineering, as a part of the BS.c degree 'Sciences for High-Tech.' In this project,
we are given a big data set with several features and observations that each describes a day.
Our role is to build models that will predict the probability of a rainy day.
Our project deals with Binary Classification with two categories classified as 1 - it was a rainy day or 0 - it was not a rainy day according to the features.
Some of the features are known, and some aren't.
